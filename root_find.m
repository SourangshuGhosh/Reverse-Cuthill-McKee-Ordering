%% ROOT_FIND finds a pseudo-peripheral node.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The diameter of a graph is the maximum distance (number of edges)
%    between any two nodes of the graph.
%
%    The eccentricity of a node is the maximum distance between that
%    node and any other node of the graph.
%
%    A peripheral node is a node whose eccentricity equals the
%    diameter of the graph.
%
%    A pseudo-peripheral node is an approximation to a peripheral node;
%    it may be a peripheral node, but all we know is that we tried our
%    best.
%
%    The routine is given a graph, and seeks pseudo-peripheral nodes,
%    using a modified version of the scheme of Gibbs, Poole and
%    Stockmeyer.  It determines such a node for the section subgraph
%    specified by MASK and ROOT.
%
%    The routine also determines the level structure associated with
%    the given pseudo-peripheral node; that is, how far each node
%    is from the pseudo-peripheral node.  The level structure is
%    returned as a list of nodes LS, and pointers to the beginning
%    of the list of nodes that are at a distance of 0, 1, 2, ...,
%    NODE_NUM-1 from the pseudo-peripheral node.

%
%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer ROOT a node in the the component of the graph for 
%    which a pseudo-peripheral node is sought.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ_NUM, the number of adjacency entries.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ_ROW(NODE_NUM+1).  Information about row I is stored
%    in entries ADJ_ROW(I) through ADJ_ROW(I+1)-1 of ADJ.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ(ADJ_NUM), the adjacency structure.
%    For each row, it contains the column indices of the nonzero entries.
%
%    Input, integer MASK(NODE_NUM), specifies a section subgraph.  Nodes
%    for which MASK is zero are ignored by FNROOT.
%
%    Input, integer NODE_NUM, the number of nodes.
%
%    Output, integer ROOT, the pseudo-peripheral node obtained.
%
%    Output, integer LEVEL_NUM, is the number of levels in the level structure
%    rooted at the node ROOT.
%
%    Output, integer LEVEL_ROW(NODE_NUM+1), LEVEL(NODE_NUM), the
%    level structure array pair containing the level structure found.
%

%
%  Determine the level structure rooted at ROOT.

%    Every node is equally good (or bad).
%
  if ( level_num == 1 )
    return
  end
%
%  Extreme case:
%    A "line graph" 0--0--0--0--0 has every node in its only level.
%    By chance, we've stumbled on the ideal root.
%
  if ( level_num == iccsze )

%  Pick any node from the last level that has minimum degree
%  as the starting point to generate a new level set.
