%% LEVEL_SET generates the connected level structure rooted at a given node.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Only nodes for which MASK is nonzero will be considered.
%
%    The root node chosen by the user is assigned level 1, and masked.
%    All (unmasked) nodes reachable from a node in level 1 are
%    assigned level 2 and masked.  The process continues until there
%    are no unmasked nodes adjacent to any node in the current level.
%    The number of levels may vary between 2 and NODE_NUM.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer ROOT, the node at which the level structure
%    is to be rooted.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ_NUM, the number of adjacency entries.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ_ROW(NODE_NUM+1).  Information about row I is stored
%    in entries ADJ_ROW(I) through ADJ_ROW(I+1)-1 of ADJ.
%
%    Input, integer ADJ(ADJ_NUM), the adjacency structure.
%    For each row, it contains the column indices of the nonzero entries.
%
%    Input, integer MASK(NODE_NUM).  On input, only nodes with nonzero
%    MASK are to be processed.  On output, those nodes which were included
%    in the level set have MASK set to 1.
%
%    Input, integer NODE_NUM, the number of nodes.
%
%    Output, integer MASK(NODE_NUM).  On input, only nodes with nonzero
%    MASK are to be processed.  On output, those nodes which were included
%    in the level set have MASK set to 1.
%
%    Output, integer LEVEL_NUM, the number of levels in the level
%    structure.  ROOT is in level 1.  The neighbors of ROOT
%    are in level 2, and so on.
%
%    Output, integer LEVEL_ROW(NODE_NUM+1), LEVEL(NODE_NUM), the rooted
%    level structure.
